title: "Computing the Laplace eigenvalue and level of Maass cusp forms"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-04-01
excerpt: 'In this paper we show that for a primitive Maass cusp form for a congruence subgroup, one can, with only 
finitely many Fourier coefficients, often solve for the level of the congruence subgroup, and in
some cases estimate the Laplace eigenvalue to arbitrarily high precision.'
